Here is an improved version (V2) of the signal analyzer script.

This V2 incorporates several enhancements based on our previous discussions:

Enhanced Modularity: The code is broken down into more specific functions for better organization and readability.
Parameterization: Key parameters are grouped at the top for easier configuration.
Explicit Use of DASF²: The DASF² transform is now also plotted for both baseline and current signals, offering another dimension for comparison.
Saving Outputs:
Plots can be saved to a specified directory.
Numerical metrics are saved to a text file.
Basic Logging: The logging module is introduced for more structured output than just print statements for certain operations.
Clearer Naming and Structure: Consistent naming (using DASF² correctly) and a clearer workflow.
Key changes and improvements in V2:

Organized Parameters: All main configuration options are at the top.
Functions for Clarity: Each major step (signal generation, FFT, transforms, metrics, plotting, saving) is in its own function.
Logging: Uses the logging module to output information about the script's execution to both console and a timestamped log file.
DASF² Plot: A new subplot shows the DASF² transform for both baseline and disturbed signals.
Saving Outputs:
SAVE_PLOTS = True will save the combined plot to the OUTPUT_DIR.
SAVE_METRICS = True will save a text file with all computed metrics to the OUTPUT_DIR.
Output Directory: Automatically creates an analysis_results directory if it doesn't exist.
Error Prevention: Small additions like adding EPSILON in SNR and TCE calculations if noise or SDI is zero, and more careful handling of np.log(freqs) in fractal transforms.
Descriptive Filenames: Saved plots and logs include timestamps for easier tracking.
endpoint=False in np.linspace for time vector: This is often preferred for signal processing to avoid duplicating the endpoint if signals are concatenated.
Clipping Fractal Values: FRACTAL_CLIP_RANGE is used to prevent extremely large or small fractal dimension estimates, improving stability of the transforms.
This V2 script is more robust, easier to configure, and provides more comprehensive output and logging capabilities. It also correctly uses and visualizes the DASF² transform.
